At this early stage, the planned structure of the manuscript is as follows:

Title - ICES data at our fingertips: an overview of new and upcoming technologies

* Bridging the gap between data and analysis

    We will introduce new technologies and pathways to read ICES data directly
    into the R software platform, where the data analysis takes place. This
    benefits scientists, both when working with scripted workflows and when
    exploring data interactively.

* R packages and web services

    Description of web service technology and the four new ICES packages in R to access
    trawl survey data, stock assessment results, stock database entries, and general
    reference codes.

* Showcasing current and potential applications

    [Trivial: survey data - North Sea cod]
    [Trivial: stock status relative to refpts - North Sea plaice]
    [Trivial: supporting lookup tables]
    [Cool: map showing Kobe plots of stock status (F/Fmsy and B/Bmsy) by ecoregion!]

    [Cite: Thorson's analysis of Datras data, others?]
	  [Cite: maps of index of recruitment (age 1) and index of SSB of groundfish]
    [Cite: analysis of length weight data from Datras]
    [Cite: fisheries overviews]


* Discussion

  Reproducible research, open science
  Makes data more approachable, easier to find errors
  Fits with modern workflow and tools: web apps, etc.
