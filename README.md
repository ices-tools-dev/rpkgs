# R packages to access ICES data

The focus of the paper should be on the end user perspective (R packages),
rather than the underlying web services.

It should fit in the **Quo Vadimus** (vision for the future) category of the
[ICES journal](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/pages/general_instructions#Categories%20of%20papers).
